# Notes:
# - These are the top-level packages directly imported by the application.
# - Their transitive dependencies (e.g. Jinja2, Werkzeug, itsdangerous, numpy)
#   will be installed automatically by pip when installing the above.
# - Pin versions (e.g. using pip freeze) if you need reproducible installs.
